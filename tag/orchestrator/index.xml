However, in practice this is hard to achieve due to the limitations of reference software platforms, such as Kubernetes, which are designed to orchestrate cloud-native services. In this work, we complement Kubernetes with a state-of-the-art algorithm for application-aware provisioning of security services. We demonstrate that the proposed solution improves basic provisioning mechanisms, such as the default Kubernetes scheduler, in terms of Quality of Service and security guarantees for the users.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
