All of these techniques are based on the minimization of a symmetric cost function as the Root Mean Square Error that equally weights positive and negative prediction errors.

However, it is well known that whatever approach is taken, a prediction error is inevitable. Two types of prediction errors can occur that have a different impact on the increase in network operational costs. In case the predicted values are higher than the real ones, the resource allocation algorithms will allocate more resources than necessary with the consequent introduction of an over-provisioning cost. Conversely, when the predicted values are lower than the real values, the allocation of fewer resources will lead to a degradation of QoS and the introduction of an under-provisioning cost. When over-provisioning and under-provisioning costs are different, most of the prediction algorithms proposed in the literature are not adequate because they are based on minimizing the mean square error or symmetric cost functions. For this reason we propose and investigate a forecasting methodology in which it is introduced an asymmetric cost function capable of weighing the costs of over-provisioning and under-provisioning differently.

The technology requires an orchestrator whose role is the service and resource orchestration. It receives service requests, each one characterized by a Service Function Chain, which is a set of service functions to be executed according to a given order. It implements an algorithm for deciding where both to allocate the cloud and bandwidth resources and to route the SFCs. In a traditional orchestration algorithm, the orchestrator has a detailed knowledge of the cloud and network infrastructures and that can lead to high computational complexity of the SFC Routing and Cloud and Bandwidth resource Allocation (SRCBA) algorithm. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the effectiveness of a scalable orchestration architecture inherited by the one proposed within the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and based on the functional separation of an NFV orchestrator in Resource Orchestrator (RO) and Network Service Orchestrator (NSO). Each cloud domain is equipped with an RO whose task is to provide a simple and abstract representation of the cloud infrastructure. These representations are notified of the NSO that can apply a simplified and less complex SRCBA algorithm. In addition, we show how the segment routing technology can help to simplify the SFC routing by means of an effective addressing of the service functions. The scalable orchestration solution has been investigated and compared to the one of a traditional orchestrator in some network scenarios and varying the number of cloud domains.

It integrates the needed processing capacity prediction procedure and the allocation one which determines the capacity under-allocation or over-allocation needed to minimize the resource allocation and Quality of Service degradation costs. The proposed solution is based on: i) a monitoring procedure in which the processing capacities required by virtual instances are periodically monitored; ii) an integrated allocation/prediction procedure in which the processing capacities to be allocated to the virtual instances are evaluated in time intervals successive to the monitoring periods. This second procedure uses a Convolutional/Long Short Term Memory neural network whose loss function is defined so as to minimize an overall cost dependent on both the cloud resource allocation and Quality of Service degradation costs. We evaluate the proposed solution in backbone and metropolitan traffic and network scenario. We show how in the traffic scenario of an Italian Mobile Operator in Milan zone, the proposed solution far outperforms the not integrated classical solution in which the capacity prediction and allocation procedures are separately performed. Furthermore its performance are very near to the one of an oracle that optimizes the capacity over/under dimensioning parameter.","tags":null,"title":"Application of an innovative convolutional/LSTM neural network for computing resource allocation in NFV network architectures","type":"publication"}]
