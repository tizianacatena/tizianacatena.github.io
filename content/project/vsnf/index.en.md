Implementation and simulation through the NS3 software of a LAN connected to a server for the transmission of CBR traffic through a TCP socket. Through NS3 and Wireshark, performance evaluations (throughput) and congestion window trends were made, in the case of single or multiple connections, homogeneous (using the same TCP protocol) or heterogeneous, in the case of a discharged network or in the presence of a bottleneck.
