abstract: "An innovative resource allocation framework for virtualized network environments and based on the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques is proposed and investigated. It integrates the needed processing capacity prediction procedure and the allocation one which determines the capacity under-allocation or over-allocation needed to minimize the resource allocation and Quality of Service degradation costs. The proposed solution is based on: i) a monitoring procedure in which the processing capacities required by virtual instances are periodically monitored; ii) an integrated allocation/prediction procedure in which the processing capacities to be allocated to the virtual instances are evaluated in time intervals successive to the monitoring periods. This second procedure uses a Convolutional/Long Short Term Memory neural network whose loss function is defined so as to minimize an overall cost dependent on both the cloud resource allocation and Quality of Service degradation costs. We evaluate the proposed solution in backbone and metropolitan traffic and network scenario. We show how in the traffic scenario of an Italian Mobile Operator in Milan zone, the proposed solution far outperforms the not integrated classical solution in which the capacity prediction and allocation procedures are separately performed. Furthermore its performance are very near to the one of an oracle that optimizes the capacity over/under dimensioning parameter."
