abstract: "In this paper the advantages of reconfiguring the cloud and bandwidth resources in a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture based on Segment Routing control/data plane is investigated when a number of maximum Service Function Chain (SFC) reconfigurations is permitted. An algorithm based on an evaluation of weight constrained shortest paths is proposed and the impact of the number of maximum permitted SFC reconfigurations on the total cloud and bandwidth cost saving is evaluated. From the results we can observe how is some cases the constraint on the number of permitted SFC reconfigurations can lead to a remarkable cost saving reduction."
